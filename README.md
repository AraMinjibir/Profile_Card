# Profile_Card
This project was designed to serve as a prectice to what I learnt this week.
I learned about background-Image and z-index. It is just a profile card but it has two Background-Images together with Background-color inside one container.
The card was centered between the first background-Image and the second one. The car has the highest z-index order, meaning to say that it stacked the two background-images.
The design was categorized into two distinct types, the first one is for those who are using Desktop and Laptop, some size specifications was stated explicitly. The second is for mobile phone users, they have their own design to access.
